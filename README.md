# The ACTS (A Common Tracking Sofware) Project

The ACTS project was launched in 2016 as a feasibility study aiming to encapsulate the common and re-usable components of the ATLAS Common Tracking Software for broader use in the community. From the very beginning it was targetting at high quality, generic, modernly designed components that can be used to assemble track and vertex reconstruction applications for high energy, nuclear and heay ion physics experiments.

ACTS is organizes in a core project `acts-project/acts` which holds the software components and a simple example/demonstration framework that showcases typical track reconstruction applications using the OpenDataDetector.
